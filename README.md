6. There is a bug in the assignment, share preference only save the state of the points
   and the count. I tried to save the state of the cards(invisible after they match, if 
   click the back key and play again should be the same state) but it is unsuccessful. 	 
   Second, there is no animation on flip the card, which indicates there is no delay on   
   flipping the second card. Ops~
